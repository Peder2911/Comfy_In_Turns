# Comfy in turns

## Generally useful R functions

This package contains some useful functions that i've written when developing things, and realized that i'd use again.

Specifically, this package was made while developing modules for the [DFI](https://github.com/peder2911/Diverse_Folio_Isle) system.

Enjoy!
